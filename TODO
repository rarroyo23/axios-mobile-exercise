Tests:
  Just was able to do one test. For the other tests I would have to mock some functions and the fetch to fake some data. 
  Than I could test what the user should see on the screen.
  
Assessibility: 
Still had to refine some of the assessibility to make sure the user knows if its a header etc...

DraftJS body: 
I don't know too much about Draft.js. So still needed to parse the draft js object. Right now I am just returning the plain text. 
But I would had done some more research on the structure of the blocks of the draft.js to be able to come up with a data structure 
to manipulate the strings at given offsets and stylings.
